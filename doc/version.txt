Detecting the EmuTOS version
============================

It has always been possible to detect the presence of EmuTOS (rather
than TOS), by looking at the last 4 bytes of the osheader structure
(which is located at the start of the ROM).  This contains the ASCII
bytes 'ETOS' if EmuTOS is the OS.  However, the various version numbers
that are available from fixed locations or via system calls are not
directly related to the EmuTOS version; rather they contain the version
of Atari TOS that is 'closest' to the current EmuTOS version in available
features/behaviour.  So it has not been possible to easily determine the
version of EmuTOS from the binary.

As of 29/October/2019, EmuTOS version information is available via a new
structure called the 'Extended OS header'.  It is located at offset 0x34
from the beginning of the ROM, and you may check for its presence by
verifying that the first 4 bytes are ASCII 'OSEX'.

Following 'OSEX' is a long containing the length of the entire structure
(currently 20), and then 4 binary bytes containing the version, in the
following sequence:
    . major version
    . minor version
    . fix version
        normally zero, but would be non-zero for a hot-fix release (also
        for versions earlier than 1.0, e.g. version 0.9.12 has 12 here)
    . unofficial flag
        zero indicates an official release, otherwise it's a snapshot
        or custom release
For example, for official release 1.0, the 4 bytes are 0x01000000; for
a snapshot release based on official release 11.5, the 4 bytes would
be 0x0b050001.

Following this is a long containing the offset to the version string as
displayed on the EmuTOS startup screen and the EmuDesk 'About' dialog box.
NOTE: this offset is from the start of the ROM, *not* the start of the
header extension!

Finally (at the moment) there is a long containing various flags which
are not related to the EmuTOS version.
